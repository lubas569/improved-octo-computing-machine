This is an adaptation of https://github.com/timothybrooks/hdr-plus, by
Timothy Brooks and Suhaas Reddy, with minimal changes added to wrap
the code in a Generator and allow for disabling manual scheduling (for
auto-schedule purposes). Code dealing with reading Raw files (via
dcraw) has been omitted.

While it is a simplifed implementation of HDR+, the align-and-merge
algorithm is substantially different, and it shares no code with
Google's HDR+.

Additional modifications were made to make the code more idiomatic
Halide. Small constant Funcs (e.g. convolution kernels and color
matrices) were rewritten to use embedded Buffers instead of a Func
with many trivial update definitions, and demosaic_output was
rewritten to use a select tree instead of an large strided RDom, which
forces 9 compute_root passes over that one Func and makes it
impossible to schedule well for humans or autoscheduling algorithms.
